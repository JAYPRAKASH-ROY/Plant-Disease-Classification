# Plant-Disease-Classification
A CNN-based image classification project that detects plant leaf diseases using EfficientNetB0 and transfer learning. Trained on the PlantVillage dataset, it accurately identifies multiple diseases and healthy leaves. The project includes a Streamlit web app for real-time predictionâ€”upload an image, and the model instantly classifies it. Supports both Keras (.keras) and TensorFlow Lite (.tflite) formats for cloud or edge deployment. Features include Grad-CAM visualization, image augmentation, performance metrics, and TFLite optimization for fast inference. Built with TensorFlow, Keras, Streamlit, and OpenCV, this project bridges AI and agriculture to enable sustainable, accessible crop health monitoring.
